Used the TA's solution to A3

I sincerely apologize for the 40 min late submission, my internet connection in my country
has been horrible due to ongoing protests. If you could not add the penalty I would really appreciate it.

Mount and Partition works perfectly fine. Got seg fault at times for write command.

I followed all the criterias given in the pdf mark scheme including following modular programming.

Use "make" command to compile and run with ./mykernel

Have a great day!
